This is about the day I learned excuses are for losers, met a guy who saw challenge in his limitations. Sometimes a small instance is all you need to change your attitude towards life and it was such instance for me.

<summary> Introduction </summary>
<br>
I was working as a customer service officer for Indigo. At the time of our training we were taught about the procedure to follow when a VVIP or Specially abled passenger is traveling in one of our flights. So, the procedure goes like this:
  
1. Onboard crew will inform the ground operations department about any such passenger.Details include:
  * Flight No.
  * Bay No. the flight will land on.
  * ETA (Expected time of arrival) of the flight.
  * Name of the passenger.
  * Seat No. he is traveling on.

2. Manager on duty will assign a CSO (Customer service officer)to attend the passenger.

3. All the details will be given to that CSO and a helper will be assigned with him.

4. CSO has to be in place to attend the passenger before ETA.

5. Escort the passenger outside of the Airport.

<summary> Incident </summary>
<br>
It was a usual day at work, I reached on time and was on the check-in counter attending passengers when my manager came and told me that one visually challenged passenger is traveling in our flight which will be landing in 30 minutes and he wants me to attend the passenger. He shared all the details with me.

I immediately took one of the helpers with me and left for the bay the flight was supposed to land.
To reach there, we exited from boarding gate and took a cab. These cabs can only drive on the path assigned to them and there speed limit is 20 km/hr. So that even if they come in the flights way by mistake, pilot would have time to deflect and save the day.

We reached the bay 10 mins before ETA and flight landed 5 mins before ETA. I entered the flight and confirmed with the crew, and went to the passengers seat and introduced myself. 

“Hi sir, my name is shubham, I’ll be assisting you today.”

“Hi Shubham, Thankyou.” he replied
I asked him if he wants his cabin bag to be carried he said “it’s ok, no need. Thanks.” then he kept talking to me asking me about random things like my family, since when I’m working with the airlines. How’s my experience been? I tried holding his hand to make him follow me but he denied and said “there is no need shubham.” (he smiled)  

Then I realised he was following my voice and then it was a smooth ride I didn’t feel for one bit that he is specially abled. I asked him sir isn’t it inconvenient to travel alone like this. Then he told me he works for some company and travels very frequently all over India and he is doing that for years.

And in no time we were outside the airport. He said he will book uber to reach to his destination. And I was ready to it for him and then he took out his phone ‘a smart phone’. He had some voice assistant app enabled, his phone was speaking to him. He ordered his phone to open uber app and booked the ride. Spoke with the cab driver, co-ordinated with him. And I was watching him mesmerised by his efficacy. He was more self dependent than most abled people.  

He thanked me and I didn’t know what he was thanking me for because It didn’t feel like I helped. I was just there talking to him like a friend, moreover it felt like a break from work. And he boarded the cab and left.

He made me a better person and taught me never to pity on myself, like we all do whenever we face hardships in life, rather find solutions and make things work. No obstacle is big enough to stop you from reaching your goal.
